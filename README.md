## 📖 About the Project

**Youthiapa** is the official merchandise website of YouTuber **Bhuvan Bam**. While the brand is well-known, its website lacked modern UI/UX design, smooth interactions, and engaging animations. I decided to take it up as my hackathon project and reimagine the entire frontend experience.

This redesign focuses on:
- Visual storytelling through animation
- Clean, responsive layout
- Performance optimization
- Seamless user interaction across all devices
